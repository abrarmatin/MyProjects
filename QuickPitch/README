1) go into QuickPitch/QuickPitch/QuickPitch (lol) through terminal. Once in that folder, open the podfile in Xcode. Make sure it is as follows:
platform :ios, '7.0'
target 'QuickPitch' do pod 'MDCSwipeToChoose' end
2) If the podfile is okay, type "pod install" and wait until finished
3) open up the quickpitch workspace and run.

4) let me know if it still doesn't work.
